# Question 7 REPORT
# Above you can see both MLE and MAP for the means of the first 6, 18, 54, and 162 samples of training data
# 
# MLE:
#     The MLE seems to be getting worse as the samples increase. It started with 0.54, and continued to decrease.
#
# MAP:
#     The MAP seemed low at first (because prior has a strong effect with little data), but was able to become 
#     it's most accurate with the 54 data samples
